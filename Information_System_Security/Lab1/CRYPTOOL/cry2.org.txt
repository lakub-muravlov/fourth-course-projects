The last decade has seen automatic face recognition evolve from small-scale research systems
to a wide range of commercial products. Driven by the FERET face database and evaluation
protocol, the currently best commercial systems achieve verification accuracies comparable to
those of fingerprint recognizers. In these experiments, only frontal face images taken under
controlled lighting conditions were used. As the use of face recognition systems expands toward
less restricted environments, the development of algorithms for view and illumination
invariant face recognition becomes important. However, the performance of current algorithms
degrades significantly when tested across pose and illumination, as documented in a number
of evaluations. In this chapter we review previously proposed algorithms for pose and illumination
invariant face recognition. We then describe in detail two successful appearance-based
algorithms for face recognition across pose, eigen light-fields, and Bayesian face subregions.
We furthermore show how both of these algorithms can be extended toward face recognition
across pose and illumination.
1 Introduction
The most recent evaluation of commercial face recognition systems shows the level of performance
for face verification of the best systems to be on par with fingerprint recognizers for
frontal, uniformly illuminated faces [38]. Recognizing faces reliably across changes in pose
and illumination has proved to be a much more difficult problem [9, 24, 38]. Although most
research has so far focused on frontal face recognition, there is a sizable body of work on pose
invariant face recognition and illumination invariant face recognition. However, face recognition
across pose and illumination has received little attention.
